# Critical Ops matchmaking system

## Description:

The Critical Ops matchmaking system will hold details about each player
and allows them to match against other players in certain game modes to gain a higher rating.
Matchmaking must be fair such that players of the same skill level and game mode are
matched against each other. Players who play the game *Critical Ops* 
can use this application to view their profile, play against others, 
and analyse their statistics from previous games. This project is important to
me because I grew up with this game (nearly 9 years ago), and it is 
currently the only game I still play while studying at UBC. The game
does not contain some of the game modes and player details in this project, so I thought this application 
could introduce  new features for the current game.

## User Stories:

### Phase 0 & 1

- As a User, I want to be able to add a player to the server*
- As a User, I want to be able to view all the players in the server
- As a User, I want to be able to play against other players based on my rank and game mode
- As a User, I want to be able to receive rewards based on my current rank
- As a User, I want to be able to view the result of my previous games
- As a User, I want to be able to report other players for cheating, so they get banned
- As a User, I want to be able to view the current items I own in my inventory

### Phase 2

- As a User, I want to have the option to save the current server to file in the main menu
- As a User, I want to have the option to load a previous server from file in the main menu

(* although a single player can have multiple accounts, we will assume 
everyone in the server is a unique person as it would be impossible for 
someone to play against themselves. Essentially, every player in the server
represents a different user)

# Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required action related to the user story "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by 
selecting the menu item labelled "Create Player."
- You can generate the second required action related to the user story "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by

extra: All the other buttons in the menu work and are successfully handled in the code. In other
