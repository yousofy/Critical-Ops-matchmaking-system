# Critical Ops 1vs1 Player System

## Description:

The Critical Ops 1vs1 Player System will hold details about each player
and allow them to match against other players to gain a higher rating.
Match-making must be fair such that players of the same skill level are
matched against each other. Players who play the game *Critical Ops* 
can use this application to view their profile, play against others, 
and analyse statistics from previous games. This project is important to
me because I grew up with this game (nearly 9 years ago), and it is 
currently the only game I  still play while studying at UBC. The game 
does not have a 1vs1 System, so I thought this application could introduce
a new feature for the current game.

## User Stories:

- As a User, I want to be able to add a player with a unique name to the server* 
- As a User, I want to be able to view all the players in the server
- As a User, I want to be able to play against other players based on my rating
- As a User, I want to be able to receive rewards based on my rating
- As a User, I want to be able to view my past games' statistics
- As a User, I want to be able to report other players for cheating

(* although a single player can have multiple accounts, we will assume 
everyone in the server is a unique person as it would be impossible for 
someone to play against themselves. Essentially, every player in the server
represents a different user)
