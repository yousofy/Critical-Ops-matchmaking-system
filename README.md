# Critical Ops 1vs1 Player System

## Description:

The Critical Ops 1vs1 Player System will hold details about each player
and allow them to match against other players to gain a higher ranking.
Match-making must be fair such that players of the same skill-level are
matched against each other. Players who play the game *Critical Ops* 
can use this application to view their profile, play against others, 
and analyse statistics from previous games. This project is important to
me because I grew up with this game (nearly 9 years ago), and it is 
currently the only game I  still play while studying at UBC. The game 
does not have a 1vs1 System, so I thought this application could introduce
a new feature for the current game.
