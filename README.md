# Critical Ops matchmaking system

## Description

The Critical Ops matchmaking system will hold details about each player
and allows them to match against other players in certain game modes to gain a higher rating.
Matchmaking must be fair such that players of the same skill level and game mode are
matched against each other. Players who play the game *Critical Ops* 
can use this application to view their profile, play against others, 
and analyse their statistics from previous games. This project is important to
me because I grew up with this game nearly 9 years ago. The game
does not contain some of the game modes and player details in this project, so I thought this application 
could introduce  new features for the current game.
