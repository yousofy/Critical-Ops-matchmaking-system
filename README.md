# Critical Ops matchmaking system

## Description

The Critical Ops matchmaking system holds details about each player
and allows them to match against other players in certain game modes to gain a higher rating.
Matchmaking must be fair such that players of the same skill level and game mode are
matched against each other. Players who play the game *Critical Ops* 
can use this application to view their profile, play against others, 
and analyse their statistics from previous games. I made this project because I grew up with this game nearly 9 years ago. 
The current game does not contain some of the game modes and player details in this project, so my application
introduces new features that could be added to the game in upcoming updates.
